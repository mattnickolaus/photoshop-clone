# Your Final Project
This is the base repository for you to start adding code for your final project.
The final structure and layout of the repository is your choosing, but there are recommended layouts and structures your may wish to follow.
Many of these conventions will be discussed in class.

## Your To Do List
- [ ] Commit your project source code and pushed to GitHub before the due date (see Canvas)
- [ ] Update the `README.md` or add a `docs` folder that explains how to run your project
